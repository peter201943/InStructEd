# Plan 2022-11-09

## A Year's Recap
- Nearly a year since my last plan was made for this project
- On a train again, figured I might as well play around with this again
- I want to focus on just doing little "experiments", as opposed to any major/serious software architecting with this
- Really, more just small UI experiments in particular
- There is a question about whether or not it's even a good idea in the first place to be using these compositions of generic godot ui elements
- Especially considering the unusual ways I intend to treat them
- And even then, of how such objects ought to be distinguished and how they ought to be treated
- For awhile I toyed with the idea of a Haskell/RacketScheme rewrite, simply to allow me to focus on trying to describe some higher-order and more-formal semantics
- It seems though that I'm more likely to just spend a lot of time merely writing about it
- I should also reflect on just what exactly it is that I want from this thing
- (`ctrl+plus;ctrl+plus`)
- There have been many other ideas since, scattered across all my various notes/note-taking-locations
- With regard to maintaining a constant and persistent perspective of editing, I have done a poor job of keeping these notes organized and accessible

## Potential Paths Forward
- Move to Godot 4.0
  - Take advantage of newer nodes
- Move to Generic Project Root
  - Allow for more diverse set of tech to be used
- Mandatory Calendar Time
  - (Set to some schedule)
- Website and Folder Blocking
  - Have access to `notes-2/daily/` and YouTube, Reddit, Discord disabled
  - (Set on some time restriction)
- Move to Web Tech
  - Web Assembly (generic runtimes)
  - Web Frameworks (Rust Tauri, JS Electron, Python Django)
  - (Provide more loose/flexible composition of things)
- Move to a Database Backend
  - Such as Postgres (Highly Structured) or MongoDB (Highly Adaptive)
  - Provides much better uniform access and reliable access time
    - As compared with DOM navigation (within a UI)
- Move Beyond JSON
  - Target other file formats/provide "hooks"/ways for other people to make interfaces to their own formats as well
  - Example common target I would want to target is GitHubMarkdown, OrgModeMarkdown, ObsidianMarkdown
      - Especially ability to target the YAMLFrontMatter for such formats
  - Ability to genuinely interface with other formats/execution-environments may be limited however
    - XML is very challenging to parse appropriately
    - Lua/Python/RON serializations may prove difficult to evaluate

## Potential Activities for Today
- Play with new Formal Semantics
  - In either Python (DataClasses)
- Play with new UI Concepts
  - Generic element compositions in Godot
  - Perhaps also languages for expressing requirements/expectations of ui-elements and ui-element-compositions
    - (Theory of Interfaces)
- Play with new Transformation Concepts
  - Lenses, Descriptions, Arbitrary
  - Languages for describing transformations
- Play with new Architecture
  - (Architectural Descriptions, in plaintext)
- Play with Project Management/Direction

## What has not Worked so far
- Expecting something/anything to happen/work
- Not scheduling/choosing time to work on this
- Sitting around and thinking about what *ought* to be done, but doing nothing as a result
- Lack of website and web deployments to show-off work on application
  - ItchIO is not good enough
  - May wish to make part of same effort as resume/show-off website

## What else exists
- The Self Hosted and Notetaking Subreddits have demoed any other notetaking/data-editing applications in the past
- What is noteworthy regarding these projects is their ability to work, and the community involvement

## Larger Concerns
- The problem of notetaking, and especially how to
  - Query/Access Notes
    - So far use of silver-searcher and basic regex is not good enough
      - Especially when it comes to recall/reuse
        - And especially *periodic*/*scheduled* recall
          - Though this is part of a larger problem of *centrality*, and of establishing and providing some "center" of reference
  - Refer/Share Notes
    - OneDrive is terrible for use with phone, but Google Keep is bad for sharing
    - Would prefer something which provides immediate, clean links, as opposed to entropic/random-hash links
  - Structure Notes
    - My notes are highly inconsistent in terms of *semantic* organization
    - (This is distinct from *Format*)
    - AKA, "style", "object structuring", "choice of elements", "per element features", "per note features"
    - This was part of the original intent of InStructEd, to provide a more consistent/guaranteed way of accessing these things
    - Especially with move to a JSON-like format
    - Also broader question of how to manage metadata for notes and general items
      - Though this is itself part of a significantly larger problem of tracking information and reflection on items aboard a computer system
  - Format Notes
    - Nevermind plaintext/binary
    - Instead question of Markdown, JSON, XML, etcetera
  - Transformation to Desired Format
    - Intake of Pictures/Images/Rich-Data
    - Intake of Paper/Physical
    - Intake of Poorly-Formatted-Digital
    - And transformation, not to a "Final" format, but to a "current" format
      - Deliberate lack of "Final" is recognition that no particular format is best/knowably best
        - And instead must preserve ability to migrate to/from various other formats
          - A Corollary to that, are the *requirements* of the *tools* to support such a stance
            - (These requirements are listed here in order of complexity/difficulty and in terms of scale, from "largest scale, simplest (most commonly understood) semantics" to "smallest scale, most complicated (least commonly understood) semantics")
            - Requirement 1: Ability to **Assuredly, Consistently, Correctly** Transform to Target Output
              - Note: Even simple things, like serializing to XML/JSON is a serious activity of assurance for the Open Source Java Jackson Parsing Project
            - Requirement 2: Ability to **Formally, Correctly, Totally** describe target output features
              - Note: This is a recursion within the "format" (eg JSON versus XML), and is moreso things like "does every node have a node id"?
            - Requirement 3: Ability to **Formally, Correctly, Totally** describe semantics of adhoc/created/one-off expressions and structures
              - Consider just the simple semantics implied by the writing style here, of "Requirement N: ... Note: ..."
                - The ability to describe these structures, of their intent, and the ability to relate them semantically to all other notetaking structures I have created will be important as well
- The parallel evolution of general computing ("Machine Learning", "Transformer Models", "Language Transformers", "Artificial Intelligence", "Large Parameter Models")
  - More "general purpose, general architecture" computation is becoming more prevalent and consuming more tasks
  - It may be worth investigating the ability of some model to consume and understand some body of text/ideas, then to attempt a rigorous type-decomposition (what I have been suggesting doing instead)
  - Unfortunately, I am not as well versed with this area of research
  - Nor am I certain that there exist ML models capable of generating UI's (which is probably more closely-aligned with what I seek)
- General Text Editing is a sufficient challenge on its own
  - Consider the effort put into making VSCode work
  - Consider the attempts to refine the semantics of notetaking in VS Code
    - Through projects such as VS Code Extension Dendron
      - Kinda clutzy ui, highly dependent upon the internal-features of VS Code
    - Through internal editor improvements
  - Consider what I am asking people to give up in favor of these more generic editors I am proposing
    - To what extent can they really integrate with their preferred tools?

## High Brow Thought
- Perhaps I need to stop thinking so much about things, and just try doing some things instead
