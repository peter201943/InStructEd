# Plan 2022-11-09

## A Year's Recap
- Nearly a year since my last plan was made for this project
- On a train again, figured I might as well play around with this again
- I want to focus on just doing little "experiments", as opposed to any major/serious software architecting with this
- Really, more just small UI experiments in particular
- There is a question about whether or not it's even a good idea in the first place to be using these compositions of generic godot ui elements
- Especially considering the unusual ways I intend to treat them
- And even then, of how such objects ought to be distinguished and how they ought to be treated
- For awhile I toyed with the idea of a Haskell/RacketScheme rewrite, simply to allow me to focus on trying to describe some higher-order and more-formal semantics
- It seems though that I'm more likely to just spend a lot of time merely writing about it
- I should also reflect on just what exactly it is that I want from this thing
- (`ctrl+plus;ctrl+plus`)
- There have been many other ideas since, scattered across all my various notes/note-taking-locations
- With regard to maintaining a constant and persistent perspective of editing, I have done a poor job of keeping these notes organized and accessible

## Potential Paths Forward
- Move to **Godot 4.0**
  - Take advantage of newer nodes
- Move to **Generic Project Root**
  - Allow for more diverse set of tech to be used
- Move to **Mandatory Calendar Time**
  - (Set to some schedule)
- Move To **Website and Folder Blocking**
  - Have access to `notes-2/daily/` and YouTube, Reddit, Discord disabled
  - (Set on some time restriction)
- Move to **Web Tech**
  - Web Assembly (generic runtimes)
  - Web Frameworks (Rust Tauri, JS Electron, Python Django)
  - (Provide more loose/flexible composition of things)
- Move to a **Database Backend**
  - Such as Postgres (Highly Structured) or MongoDB (Highly Adaptive)
  - Provides much better uniform access and reliable access time
    - As compared with DOM navigation (within a UI)
- Move **Beyond JSON**
  - Target other file formats/provide "hooks"/ways for other people to make interfaces to their own formats as well
  - Example common target I would want to target is GitHubMarkdown, OrgModeMarkdown, ObsidianMarkdown
      - Especially ability to target the YAMLFrontMatter for such formats
  - Ability to genuinely interface with other formats/execution-environments may be limited however
    - XML is very challenging to parse appropriately
    - Lua/Python/RON serializations may prove difficult to evaluate
- Move **Beyond Data Editing**
  - Rename the project to `better-notetaking`
  - Have the focus of it be on documenting/experimenting/describing/comparing ways for doing so

## Potential Activities for Today
- Play with new Formal Semantics
  - In either Python (DataClasses)
- Play with new UI Concepts
  - Generic element compositions in Godot
  - Perhaps also languages for expressing requirements/expectations of ui-elements and ui-element-compositions
    - (Theory of Interfaces)
- Play with new Transformation Concepts
  - Lenses, Descriptions, Arbitrary
  - Languages for describing transformations
- Play with new Architecture
  - (Architectural Descriptions, in plaintext)
- Play with Project Management/Direction
  - Establish better guarantees for project completion and direction

## What has not Worked so far
- Not scheduling/choosing time to work on this
  - And the related problem of expecting something/anything to happen/work
- Sitting around and thinking about what *ought* to be done, but doing nothing as a result
  - High Brow Thought
    - Perhaps I need to stop thinking so much about things, and just try doing some things instead
      - Especially the *thinking about how much time I spend thinking about things*
        - Granted, *knowing* what to do when setting out to do *something* is perhaps a bigger issue...
- Lack of website and web deployments to show-off work on application
  - ItchIO is not good enough
  - May wish to make part of same effort as resume/show-off website
- Taking Daily adhoc and unsorted/untagged notes
  - Granted, taking the necessary time and effort to appropriate tag these items is exhausting
    - And it is not necessarily known if there is a "correct" way to tag these items
      - And of how best to preserve/indicate history when transforming/revising said notes

## Larger Concerns
- The problem of notetaking, and especially how to
  - Query/Access Notes
    - So far use of silver-searcher and basic regex is not good enough
      - Especially when it comes to recall/reuse
        - And especially *periodic*/*scheduled* recall
          - Though this is part of a larger problem of *centrality*, and of establishing and providing some "center" of reference
  - Refer/Share Notes
    - OneDrive is terrible for use with phone, but Google Keep is bad for sharing
    - Would prefer something which provides immediate, clean links, as opposed to entropic/random-hash links
  - Structure Notes
    - My notes are highly inconsistent in terms of *semantic* organization
    - (This is distinct from *Format*)
    - AKA, "style", "object structuring", "choice of elements", "per element features", "per note features"
    - This was part of the original intent of InStructEd, to provide a more consistent/guaranteed way of accessing these things
    - Especially with move to a JSON-like format
    - Also broader question of how to manage metadata for notes and general items
      - Though this is itself part of a significantly larger problem of tracking information and reflection on items aboard a computer system
  - Format Notes
    - Nevermind plaintext/binary
    - Instead question of Markdown, JSON, XML, etcetera
  - Transformation to Desired Format
    - Intake of Pictures/Images/Rich-Data
    - Intake of Paper/Physical
    - Intake of Poorly-Formatted-Digital
    - And transformation, not to a "Final" format, but to a "current" format
      - Deliberate lack of "Final" is recognition that no particular format is best/knowably best
        - And instead must preserve ability to migrate to/from various other formats
          - A Corollary to that, are the *requirements* of the *tools* to support such a stance
            - (These requirements are listed here in order of complexity/difficulty and in terms of scale, from "largest scale, simplest (most commonly understood) semantics" to "smallest scale, most complicated (least commonly understood) semantics")
            - Requirement 1: Ability to **Assuredly, Consistently, Correctly** Transform to Target Output
              - Note: Even simple things, like serializing to XML/JSON is a serious activity of assurance for the Open Source Java Jackson Parsing Project
            - Requirement 2: Ability to **Formally, Correctly, Totally** describe target output features
              - Note: This is a recursion within the "format" (eg JSON versus XML), and is moreso things like "does every node have a node id"?
            - Requirement 3: Ability to **Formally, Correctly, Totally** describe semantics of adhoc/created/one-off expressions and structures
              - Consider just the simple semantics implied by the writing style here, of "Requirement N: ... Note: ..."
                - The ability to describe these structures, of their intent, and the ability to relate them semantically to all other notetaking structures I have created will be important as well
- The parallel evolution of general computing ("Machine Learning", "Transformer Models", "Language Transformers", "Artificial Intelligence", "Large Parameter Models")
  - More "general purpose, general architecture" computation is becoming more prevalent and consuming more tasks
  - It may be worth investigating the ability of some model to consume and understand some body of text/ideas, then to attempt a rigorous type-decomposition (what I have been suggesting doing instead)
  - Unfortunately, I am not as well versed with this area of research
  - Nor am I certain that there exist ML models capable of generating UI's (which is probably more closely-aligned with what I seek)
- General Text Editing is a sufficient challenge on its own
  - Consider What else exists
    - The Self Hosted and Notetaking Subreddits have demoed any other notetaking/data-editing applications in the past
    - What is noteworthy regarding these projects is their ability to work, and the community involvement
  - Consider the effort put into making VSCode work
  - Consider the attempts to refine the semantics of notetaking in VS Code
    - Through projects such as VS Code Extension Dendron
      - Kinda clutzy ui, highly dependent upon the internal-features of VS Code
    - Through internal editor improvements
  - Consider what I am asking people to give up in favor of these more generic editors I am proposing
    - To what extent can they really integrate with their preferred tools?

## Choosing a Path Forward
- After Reviewing [Potential Paths Forward](#potential-paths-forward)
- After Reviewing [What has not Worked so far](#what-has-not-worked-so-far)
- After Reviewing [Larger Concerns](#larger-concerns)
- I am going to start a new project called `better-notetaking`
- The primary focus of this project will be to document my thoughts and ideas regarding notetaking
  - This project is not interested in making a study of itself, and as such will not be interested in the preservation of the files within itself
  - This project will be published on a public website, and so any tangential/unsafe content must be collected elsewhere
  - The project should also document my research of machine-learning-research on the topic of textual-comprehension and transformation
  - A major product of this project is some system of tagging, and especially some way of interactively exploring said tags
  - This project is essentially a blog
- Various app-ideas and scripts/etcetera should be collected into their own separate folders within an `experiments/` folder
  - (And each experiment should have an accompanying `readme` with a start-date and brief-description-of-intent)
- I will set a weekly pace of progress on this project, with emphasis on Saturday Morning contributions
  - (Daily notes are to be collected on smartphone using Obsidian and destructively synced manually via USB)
  - This must/should impact my production of "daily" notes
    - A good question/research would be just what percent of these notes
      - 1. exist
      - 2. contain meaningful/useful content
      - 3. were not created out of accident/distraction
  - Deliberate steps must therefore be taken to avoid the disaster which is daily notetaking
    - Many of my daily notes concern the topic of notetaking, and may themselves be useful to such
    - I often have a hard time figuring out *where*/*what category* some note ought apply to
      - I also often end up with multiple hard-to-sort ideas in a single daily note
    - Therefore, perhaps the efforts ought to be more-focused on either
      - 1. **RENAMING** daily-created-notes to something more specific
      - 2. **SPLITTING** daily-created-notes into separate items
      - 3. **RELATING**  daily-created-notes to other, already-existing notes
        - (And of also revisiting previously created notes)
- A major focus of the writing should be on establishing a thoroughly dense cross-reference across notes (notes referencing other notes)
  - Certain tools may be more amenable to this effort than others, such as Obsidian (with its graph view)
    - However, I am as yet still uncomfortable with using Obsidian, and need to take the time to better learn it
- I do not think that the experiments should be hosted on the web, they are to be more-focused on simply exploring an idea, and allowing for me to better understand it
  - This will be used in my writings
  - Essentially, the purpose of `experiments` is to serve as an ideas-generator
- The backend/underlying-data-representation
  - is likely to remain independent-plaintext-markdown-files
  - and not a database, not even NoSQL (such as MongoDB)
